THIS ONE TOOK A LOT OF TIME
Just adding this be a timeline for me
now lets talk about the code ;)
SO this one is a kind of  word finder and replacer (And yeah it does a pretty basic job)
so it does simple as in the name , it finds the word (or combination of letters) and just replaces them with what u say 
 (NOW HERE COMES THE BEAUTY OF CODE--->) now in the given question, it was required to make three functions
1- One for if the find word lenght is same as the replace word lenght
2- one for if the find word lenght is greater than the replace word lenght
3- one for if the find word lenght is smaller than the replace word lenght
NOW , u have to make seperate function for the same lenght replacement (1-) BUT fot the other two i made a function which is able to handle both of the functions  ðŸ¤¯
IF U WANT TO SEE THAT JUST GO IN THE CODE and delete the any big or large function(just the names are diff but the code for both is exact same) and just change the callout for the function in the if else statement
I will be uploading more codes (IF I GOT THE TIME TO DOðŸ‘¾)
If u have any query , feel free to reach out to me 
for now KILLER OUT ....ðŸ‘¾
